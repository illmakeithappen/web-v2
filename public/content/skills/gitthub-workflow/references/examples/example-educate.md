# Complete Guide to Comparing Video Editing Tools

**Target Completion Time:** 2 hours  
**Total Steps:** 7

---

## Step 1: Understand Software Categories

**Instruction:**

```text
Ask Claude to break down video editing software into three main tiers
(professional, mid-range, entry-level) using simple analogies like cars or
restaurants. Request clear explanations of who each tier targets and what
distinguishes them from each other.
```

**Deliverable:** _Clear mental model of video editing software categories with easy-to-understand analogies and target user descriptions_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude

---

## Step 2: Design Evaluation Framework

**Instruction:**

```text
Request Claude to create comprehensive evaluation criteria covering technical
specifications, user interface design, feature sets, and pricing with detailed
explanations of why each criterion matters for different users. Ask for scoring
guidelines and weighting suggestions based on user priorities.
```

**Deliverable:** _Structured framework with specific criteria, explanations, and scoring guidelines for evaluating any video editing tool_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude
- Skills: tool-comparison-framework

---

## Step 3: Analyze Top Tools

**Instruction:**

```text
Have Claude provide detailed analysis of 2-3 leading tools from each tier (like
Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Filmora) with concrete examples of their
strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases. Request specific feature comparisons
and performance benchmarks where available.
```

**Deliverable:** _In-depth profiles of 6-9 top video editing tools with specific strengths, weaknesses, and real-world performance examples_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude

---

## Step 4: Create Decision Flowchart

**Instruction:**

```text
Use Claude Code to generate an interactive flowchart that asks about budget,
skill level, intended use, and hardware constraints, then provides specific tool
recommendations with reasoning. Include decision points for common scenarios
like YouTube creation, business marketing, or personal projects.
```

**Deliverable:** _Interactive visual flowchart that matches user needs and constraints to optimal video editing tool recommendations_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude Code
- References: Step 2 evaluation framework, Step 3 tool profiles

---

## Step 5: Walk Through Real Scenarios

**Instruction:**

```text
Request Claude to demonstrate tool selection through 4-5 detailed real-world
scenarios (YouTube creator, small business marketing, family videos, film
student, etc.) with step-by-step reasoning showing how different needs lead to
different optimal choices. Ask for alternative options and trade-off discussions
for each scenario.
```

**Deliverable:** _Step-by-step decision examples for common video editing scenarios with reasoning and alternative tool considerations_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude
- References: Step 2 evaluation framework, Step 3 tool profiles

---

## Step 6: Understand Total Cost

**Instruction:**

```text
Have Claude explain hidden costs beyond software price including hardware
requirements, training time, subscription fees, plugin costs, and ecosystem
lock-in risks. Request analysis of long-term costs and integration benefits for
different tools and workflows.
```

**Deliverable:** _Complete cost-benefit analysis framework including hidden costs, hardware needs, and long-term considerations_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude
- References: Step 3 tool profiles

---

## Step 7: Generate Personal Checklist

**Instruction:**

```text
Ask Claude to create a customizable evaluation checklist with specific questions
about your needs, constraints, and priorities, plus red flags to watch for and
must-have features to identify. Request the checklist in a format you can easily
modify and use for hands-on tool testing.
```

**Deliverable:** _Personalized checklist with assessment questions, red flags, and must-have features for evaluating video editing software_

**Uses:**
- Tools: Claude
- Skills: feature-analysis-checklist
- References: Step 2 evaluation framework, Step 6 cost analysis
