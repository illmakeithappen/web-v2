# Workflows:

Workflows are at the heart of gitthub. A workflow is nothing more but a simple set of instructions. Alright, you say, why would someone need a set of stepwise instructions in the age of ai? First of all, the instructions are not only for you, but also for the fellow agents u use. 

It is hard to harness the capabilities of artificial intelligence, especially across a diverse set of ever evolving tools, agents, and possibilities to deploy ai.

A provider agnostic, holistic approach of working with ai therefore yields the great advantage of being less prone to becoming outdated.

So unlike make, zapier or n8n, u wont be building an agentic system, you go above that and design a simple system of how to make use of agentic systems. its a meta level, not concerning to much about the agentic work but much rather directly about the process and the outcomes itself and want needs to be specified. 

Put differently, gitthub does not attempt to deliver a new framework for agentic systems, but much rather a set of instructions for humans and agentic systems to work together. So you can either use gitthub workflows to set agentic systems in context, steer them or even automate them. It might be one step closer to fully mimic human behaviour by machines.

This is made possible by the new anthropic feature: claude skills. This approach heavily leverages claude skills and puts them into a framework that makes the most out of them.

There is three archetypes of workflows: 

### Navigate: 

Navigate workflows have the purpose to take u on a journey and let you compare different approaches or explore possibilities.

### Educate:

Educate workflows help you make the most out of a certain tool, skill, or workflow. Educate workflows aim to foster ur understanding of a selected topic by letting you execute different possibilities and see the differences while getting explained the basics of how something works.
### Deploy: 

Deploy workflows are your go to how to guides. if you wanna bring some shit on the ground, this is your way. the workflow skill will help you set up whatever you feel like by modularizing the
